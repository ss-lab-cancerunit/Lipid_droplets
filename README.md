Transcriptomic Profiling of the Lipid-NLRP3 Immunometabolic Axis

This repository was developed by Yujia Zhang (supervised by Shamith Samarajiwa) for the lipid droplet project from Paras Anand Lab at Imperial College London, and is partially adapted from a Master's thesis in MSc Molecular Medicine.

Background:
The NLRP3 inflammasome is a central driver in numerous inflammatory and metabolic disorders. While conventional therapeutics target the inflammatory pathway directly, emerging evidence suggests that metabolic reprogramming offers a novel strategy for modulating NLRP3 activity.

Lipid metabolism is a critical regulatory node in this process; however, current research is fragmented, often focusing on isolated lipids. This project employs a systems biology approach to discover the molecular mechanisms governing the intracellular lipid profile during inflammasome activation.

Study Design & Data:
To decode the transcriptional regulation of immunometabolism, we performed a comprehensive bulk RNA-seq analysis using two publicly available datasets.

Model: Mouse Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages (BMDMs).
Conditions: Control/ Untreated; LPS (from GSE224239); LPS + ATP (from GSE286554).

Goal: To identify upstream transcriptional drivers and dynamic changes in lipid metabolism-related pathways.

Key Findings:
Our bioinformatic analysis revealed a significant lipid metabolic reorganization occurring downstream of NLRP3 activation.

Enhanced Lipid Sensitivity: Transcriptional signatures indicate a marked increase in cellular responsiveness to lipid signals.
Pathway Enrichment: Multiple rate-limiting metabolic genes were differentially expressed and significantly enriched in lipid synthesis and storage pathways.

Experimental Validation (PA Lab):
Validation: Wet-lab experiments confirmed that NLRP3 activation drives lipid droplet accumulation.
Novel Insight: Crucially, we found a bidirectional relationship: Lipid Droplet accumulation itself promotes NLRP3 activation.

Conclusion: Lipid droplets are not merely passive storage organelles or byproducts of metabolic changes; they act as active regulators of inflammation.
